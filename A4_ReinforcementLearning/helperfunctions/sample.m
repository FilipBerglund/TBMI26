% SAMPLE randomly selects one of the given values with the given probabilies.
% This function is used by chooseaction. You don't have to use this

% Example:
%     out = sample([1 2 3 4], [0.2 0.1 0.1 0.6]);
%     will give out=1 with probability 0.2, out=2 with prob. 0.1 etc...

p = cumsum(probs(:));
p = p / p(end);
out = find(p > rand);
